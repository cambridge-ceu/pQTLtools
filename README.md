Under Fedora 28 it is possible with 

```bash
latex 2001
bibtex 2001
latex 2001
latex 2001
dvips 2001
dvipdf 2001
```

Under Ubuntu 18.04, the following change is required.

\epsfig{file=foo,a=b,x=y}

becomes

\includegraphics[a=b,x=y]{foo}

nevertheless the original 2001.dvi is sufficient to regenerate 2001.pdf with better quality text (OCR).
