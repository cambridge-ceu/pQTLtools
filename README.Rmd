## A protein Quantitative Trait Locus toolkit

This seeds collection of data and utilties for pQTL analysis. At
this early stage, the repository collects information on a number of
protein panels, linking functions for cis/trans classification, 2D
manhattan plots, 3D-plotly plots, forest plots among others availale
from [R/gap](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/R/tree/master/gap)[^gap];
query results on genes, regions, and SNPs via PhenoScanner, adding
functionality to check for replication across platforms and aspects
of protein-related analysis such as pQTL-Mendelian Randomization
via TwoSampleMR, linkage through UniProt IDs to other resources.
Bioconductor analyses and snakemake workflow are also showcased.

Note that some steps involving data from ongoing project have been
simplified to use files in `~/pQTLtools/tests`which can be made
public when appropriate.

## Installation

The latest version of pQTLtools can be installed as usual:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jinghuazhao/pQTLtools")
```

Dependencies are detailed in the DECRIPTION file of the package at GitHub.

## June 2022 update

It passes CRAN checks with no warning.

## February 2021 update 

A web-driven documentation is now available.

[https://jinghuazhao.github.io/pQTLtools/](https://jinghuazhao.github.io/pQTLtools/)

## A summary of datasets and functions

This can be seen from R with

```r
library(help=pQTLtools)
```
