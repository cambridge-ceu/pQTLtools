## A protein Quantitative Trait Locus toolkit

It seeds collection of data and utilities for pQTL analysis. At this
early stage, the repository contains 1. Articles linking functions
for cis/trans classification, 2d Manhattan plots, 2d/3d-plotly plots,
forest plots among others available from
[gap](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/R/tree/master/gap);
2. query on genes, regions, and SNPs via [PhenoScanner](http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/), adding
functionality to check for replication across platforms; 3. downstream
analysis such as colocalization, pQTL-Mendelian Randomization via
[TwoSampleMR](https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR), linkage through UniProt IDs to other resources;
4. Bioconductor notes and a showcase of snakemake workflow.

Aspects involving data from ongoing project have been simplified to use
files in `pQTLtools/tests`which can be made public when appropriate.

## Installation

The latest version of pQTLtools can be installed as usual:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jinghuazhao/pQTLtools")
```

Dependencies are detailed in the DECRIPTION file of the package at GitHub.

## December 2022 update

A new package pQTLdata is created to hold panel and meta data.

## June 2022 update

It passes [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) checks with no warning.

## February 2021 update 

A web-driven documentation is now available.

## A summary of datasets and functions

This can be seen from R with

```r
library(help=pQTLtools)
```

or
