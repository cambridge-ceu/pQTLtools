## A protein Quantitative Trait Locus toolkit

It seeds collection of data and utilties for pQTL analysis. At this
early stage, the repository contains 1. a number of protein panels,
linking functions for cis/trans classification, 2D Manhattan plots,
3D-plotly plots, forest plots among others availale from
[R/gap](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/R/tree/master/gap);
2. query on genes, regions, and SNPs via PhenoScanner, adding
functionality to check for replication across platforms; 3. downstream
analysis such as colocalization, pQTL-Mendelian Randomization via
TwoSampleMR, linkage through UniProt IDs to other resources; 4. showcase
of Bioconductor packages and snakemake workflow.

Aspects involving data from ongoing project have been simplified to use
files in `~/pQTLtools/tests`which can be made public when appropriate.

## Installation

The latest version of pQTLtools can be installed as usual:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jinghuazhao/pQTLtools")
```

Dependencies are detailed in the DECRIPTION file of the package at GitHub.

## June 2022 update

It passes CRAN checks with no warning.

## February 2021 update 

A web-driven documentation is now available.
