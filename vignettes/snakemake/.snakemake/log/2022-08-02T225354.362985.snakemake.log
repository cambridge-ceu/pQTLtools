Error in rule aggregate_MR:
    jobid: 3
    output: output/MR.HF.csv
    shell:
        awk 'NR == FNR {print; next} FNR > 1' --trait HF output/MR/CD40.HF.csv output/MR/CD40.HF2.csv output/MR/OPG.HF.csv output/MR/OPG.HF2.csv > output/MR.HF.csv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job aggregate_MR since they might be corrupted:
output/MR.HF.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
