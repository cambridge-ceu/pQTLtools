MissingOutputException in line 5 of /home/jhz22/pQTLtools/inst/snakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/Obs.csv
output/MR.csv completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
