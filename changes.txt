Chapters 1-4 have been revised according to examiners' report, and refleced
in the Abstract and Chapter 8.  There are also some minor changes in other
part of the thesis.


Chapter 1.

Give more details at a number of places.  Move some historic notes to
beginning of the chapter. Itemise contributions from Drs Sham and Curtis in
bibliographic notes (p23).


Chapter 2.

Methods:

Create subsections to make the presentation easier to read (pp26-30).

Expand description for MLOD, MALOD, MFLOD with mathematical definitions and
justification for their asymptotic distributions, as defined in published
paper (pp26-27).

Describe more on model selection (pp27-28):  The use of common dominant and
common recessive models conform to the accepted notion of parametric linkage
analysis for complex traits (e.g.  Clerget-Darpoux et al.  1986; Hodge et al.
1997).  The minor gene models are multiplicative with genotypic relative risks
4 and 3.

Give more details on calculation (pp28-29):  The calculation of LOD, ALOD,
MLOD, MALOD and MFLOD over fine grid values of f1 and alpha.  The number of
replicates is determined by LOD and ALOD in a way to achieve 90% power at
significance level 0.0001.

Add illustration with family type 1 (pp30-31).

Results:

Tables (2.2,2.3,2.4) now become Tables (2.4,2.2,2.3) (pp 33-35). Reorganise
results and add more descriptions (pp32-33).

Discussion:

Add discussion on generalisation of multiplicative models and limitation
regarding anticonservative nature of some tests (pp34-35).


Chapter 3.

Give more details on definitions of model-based and model-free statistics
(pp39-41).  Each statistic now has a separate definition.  The calculation of
required sample sizes is now in the same fashion as in Chapter 2, although both
were used in the literature, e.g.  Wald (1943) Trans Amer Math Soc 54:  426-482
section 14; Zhao et al.  (1999) Ann Hum Genet 63:  167-179.

Add Pearson chi-squared and log-likelihood ratio tests of allele-wise table
(p41), the latter is more comparable to the model-based log-likelihood ratio
tests than the former as specified in examiners' report.  Program fehp, which
represent the author's recent work, is used in place of EH to repeat all
calculation.

More discussion on results:  The performances of model-based and model-free
statistics compared to ordinary contingency table tests offer rather useful
information (p43).

More discussion is added (p45).


Chapter 4.

Rewrite description on equation (4.1) (p50)


Appendix: Add program for calculating required sample sizes for Chapter 3.
