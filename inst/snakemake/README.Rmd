Steps to set up the environment are outlined in [notes](notes/README.md), while `MendelianRandomization` v0.6.0 is used together with a bug fix in `workflow/r/MR_functions.R`. The workflow has been heavily edited for simplicity and efficiency.
Currently `input/` contains data on the 26 overlapping proteins (no information on IL-4) from the Olink cvd1 & inf1 panels and heart failures.

The document is knitted with `Rscript -e 'knitr::knit("README.Rmd")'` running code chunks below to give `output`/`MR.csv` (MR results) and `Obs.csv` (meta-analysis results based on observational studies).

```{bash snakemake, message=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
module load miniconda3/4.5.1
export csd3path=/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-projects/olink_proteomics/scallop/miniconda37
source activate ${csd3path}
# a dry run (-n).
snakemake --dry-run
# run (-c all on all available cores without --use-conda option as local packages are more up-to-date)
snakemake --cores all
# contrast with original output for OPG
# grep OPG output/MR.csv | diff - <(grep OPG ~/COVID-19/cvd1-hf/results/res_MR_aggregate.csv)
```

Some ancillary work is also ready.

```bash
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf
snakemake --rulegraph | dot -Tpdf > rulegraph.pdf
snakemake --report report.html
```
