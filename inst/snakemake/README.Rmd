# CVD1/INF1 protein-HF analysis

Included here is data on a total of 27 overlapping proteins from the Olink cvd1 & inf1 panels.

Steps to set up the environment are outlined in [notes/README.md](notes/README.md). Note `config.yaml` uses `MendelianRandomization` v0.6.0 and a bug in `workflow/scripts/MR_functions.R` is fixed.
The directory `input/` can potentially be built from rules defined in the workflow.

```{bash all-in-one}
module load miniconda3/4.5.1
export mypath=${HOME}/COVID-19/miniconda37
conda activate ${mypath}
# A dry run to show details of the workflow.
snakemake -n
# Analysis (no --use-conda option since all R packages are more up-to-date locally)
snakemake -c all
```

which gives `output`/`MR.csv` (MR results) and `Obs.csv` (observational results).
