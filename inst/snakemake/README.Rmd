# CVD1/INF1 protein-HF analysis

A total of 27 proteins were identified from the Olink/cvd1 panel overlapped with inf1. The following script furnishes run on CSD3 (no --use-conda option for `snakemake` as all R packages are locally available).

## setup

```{bash setup}
module load miniconda3/4.5.1
export mypath=${HOME}/COVID-19/miniconda37
conda activate ${mypath}
```

## dry-run

```{bash dry-run}
snakemake -n
```

## run

```{bash run}
snakemake -c all
```

which gives `results`/`Observational.csv` (observational results) and `MR_aggregate.csv` (MR results).

## Additional information

See [work/README.Rmd](work/README.Rmd) for steps to set up the environment, and `config.yaml` is modified to use `MendelianRandomization` v0.6.0 with a bug in `workflow/scripts/MR_functions.R` being fixed.
