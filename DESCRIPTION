Description: This repository collects information on a number of
    protein panels, linking function for cis/trans classification, 2D
    manhattan plots, 3D-plotly plots, forest plots among others availale
    from R/gap; query results on genes, regions, and SNPs via
    PhenoScanner, adding functionality to check for replication across
    platforms and aspects of protein-related analysis such as
    pQTL-Mendelian Randomization via TwoSampleMR, linkage through UniProt
    IDs to other resources.
