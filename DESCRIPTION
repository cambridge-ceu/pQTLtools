Description: It seeds collection of data and utilities for pQTL analysis. At this
    early stage, the repository contains 1. Articles linking functions
    for cis/trans classification, 2d Manhattan plots, 2d/3d-plotly plots,
    forest plots among others available from
    gap, <https://github.com/jinghuazhao/R/tree/master/gap>;
    2. Query on genes, regions, and SNPs via PhenoScanner,
    <http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/>, adding functionality
    to check for replication across platforms; 3. Downstream analysis
    such as colocalization, pQTL-Mendelian Randomization via TwoSampleMR,
    <https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR>, linkage through UniProt IDs
    to other resources; 4. Bioconductor notes and a showcase of snakemake
    workflow.
